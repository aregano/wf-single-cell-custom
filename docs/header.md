# Workflow single-cell

wf-single-cell is a research pipeline designed to identify the cell barcode
and UMI sequences present in nanopore sequencing reads generated from single-cell gene expression libraries. 

It was initially created as a Nextflow port of [Sockeye](https://github.com/nanoporetech/sockeye).
